# Push_Swap

## Description

    The "Push_swap" project is all about sorting a stack of 
    numbers with the fewest possible moves, using only a 
    limited set of operations. It's an algorithm puzzle 
    designed to test both creativity and efficiency .

    The idea is simple : you start with a list of unsorted 
    integers, and your goal is to print out a sequence of 
    operations that will sort that list. But there's a catch:
    you can only use two stacks, and you're limited to a 
    specific set of commands (push, swap, rotate, and their
    variations). that means every counts, and finding the optimal
    solution is both challenging and rewarding.

    Throughout this project, I learned a great deal about algorithm
    optimization, stack operations, and the trade-offs between 
    brute-force versus efficient sorting methods.

## Instructions

### How To Compile
    To build the project, just run 'make'

```bash
make
```

    This will generate an executable called 'push_swap'.

### How To Use

    Run the program with a list of integers as arguments:

```bash
./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8
```

    The output will be a list of operations to sort tthe numbers. If you pass a sorted list, the program prints nothing.
